# Quizeo

### :construction: Work In Progress

My sister has recently started to train as an Air Traffic Controller. As part of her training she needs to be able to identify loads of different aircraft by appearance. To do her a solid, I decided to build a JavaScript quiz app which will present her with random images of planes drawn from her syllabus, each accompanied by several multiple choice text options for her to choose from.

Quizeo will begin life as a simple web app, but hopefully I can turn it into an android app so that Leo (my sister, hence 'Quizeo') will be the envy of all her NATS classmates...
